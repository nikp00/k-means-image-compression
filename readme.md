# k-means-image-compression

Final project of my Parallel and Distributed Systems and Algorithms class.

In this project i implemented a image compression algorithm based on k-means clustering. The algorithm is implemented in plain C (serial implementation), C + OpenMP (CPU parallel implementation) and in C + OpenCL (GPU parallel implementation).
